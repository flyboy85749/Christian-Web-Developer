## Usage 

This site was developed as an additional web presence for my web development services. I formerly did freelance web design and development work under the Prescott Websites branding, but decided to rebrand myself not for where I live, but for my core values. I also own the domain tucsonazwebsites.com, which I may also develop in the future.
